# Submission: Brief Project Description & Reflection


This is my ruby rails project on Codio, called moldy peppers inspired by rotten potatoes. 
It is a games review which user can Create games with review, Update reviews and start, Retrieves the review(sort search), Deletes a review.
My experience with ruby enjoyable when not stuck and frustrated with two things, 
Unit test took in the current time including milliseconds which is for freezing time, causing the object to differ. 
The other problem was that it was the rail-way or the high-way at most
Some feature I did like where
Cucumber testing, it simple and easy to follow and the scenario file was very useful explain the functionality of test coverage 
I also like how some test where auto generated allowing me enhance them and allowed me to get them to pass
I db integration + set-up was extremely efficient and needed very little modification 
Codio was quite good in terms of set-up with git and ruby commands cause no set-up was needed and even with bad internet I did not see any lag while using the online editor

I had it original uploaded to a different repository that I made, link is https://github.com/Eoin-Lernihan/Final-Project-Software-develop
